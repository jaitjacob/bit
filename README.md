# Bit States
1. Bit's blue-white <b>"Neutral"</b> form is achieved by morphing it in a *loop* from a [compound of a dodecahedron and icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_of_dodecahedron_and_icosahedron) to the [seventh stellation of an icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seventh_stellation_of_icosidodecahedron&action=edit&redlink=1) and back again.

2. When Bit says <b>"Yes,"</b> it transforms into a yellow/orange [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron).

3. When it says <b>"No,"</b> it turns red and morphs into the [second stellation of an icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_stellation_of_icosahedron).

# UI
