# Bit States
1. Bit's blue-white <b>"Neutral"</b> form is achieved by morphing it in a *loop* from a compound of a [dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron) and [icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron) to the seventh stellation of an [icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron) and back again.

2. When Bit says <b>"Yes,"</b> it transforms into a yellow/orange [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron).

3. When it says <b>"No,"</b> it turns red and morphs into the [second stellation of an icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_stellation_of_icosahedron).

# UI
